by combining three existing techniques: abduction, belief revision and conceptual
change (ABC). Based on devised mathematical models, the ABC system repairs faulty
theories with better results than the individual techniques it combines because of its
various operations: 1) add/delete axioms; 2) add/delete preconditions from rules; 3)
change the language of the theory. Furthermore, ABC has wide applications, e.g.
modelling game theory by abductively explaining given observations; root-cause
analysis in system maintenance, and it has the potential to be extended to data in other
formats.

    My dissertation was about the development of a software system with UI, which forecasts the power range of high-
frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR). Based on the mechanism of HFSWR
detection, simulation models were established for the surface wave propagation, target
echo, clutter jamming (environmental noise and sea clutter) and the signal-noise ratio
of HFSWR. It was implemented in C/C# and Fortran languages. As a result, the user
interface software predicts the scope of HFSWR. </p>
